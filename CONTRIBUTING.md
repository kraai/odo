# How to contribute to odo

## **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub
  under [Issues](https://github.com/kraai/odo/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open
  a new one](https://github.com/kraai/odo/issues/new).  Be sure to
  include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant
  information as possible, and an **executable test case**
  demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and
  solution.  Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

## **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change to kraai@ftbfs.org and start writing code.
* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive
  feedback about the change.  GitHub issues are primarily intended for
  bug reports and fixes.

## **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask kraai@ftbfs.org any questions about odo's source code.

odo is a volunteer effort.  I encourage you to pitch in and join me!

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:
